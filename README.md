# NS65816
NEON Sunrise W65C816 Computer

The NEON Sunrise is my hobbyist computer to design what I would have loved to have had as a kid.
Starting with the C64 as a concept, but with the upgraded capability of the Apple IIgs and SNES using a 65816.

Goals include:
- ATX Power Capable  (Possibly PicoATX)
- ATX Case Mounts    (Probably Flex-ATX or Mini-ITX)
- 128KB of system RAM (beyond the Zero Page and Stack)
- 4 SNES Controller Ports
- VGA Output at 400x300 @ 256 colors
- Serial Interface
- Boots to a Commodore-esque BASIC prompt
- Expansion boards via card slots
- On board LCD/LED Status Screen, including clock

Stretch goals include:
- Cartridge port
- Community developments
- Programming contests?
- Some really cool stuff that I haven't even dreamed of yet.

I am archiving this project on 4/1/2024 to start over.  This will remain for reference, but I need to start over with a new understanding.
